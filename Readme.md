# SPACE INVADER GAME THINGY IN PYTHON

- I created this game with a help of google search and youtube lol stole all the images from flatIcons and Free Picks so credit to them for this
- I just wanted to see how this field will be for me and no thank you I do not like game dev at all but this was fun nonetheless
- I wish I could give you steps on how to create it but .....jk it is below have fun coding


## Steps to play it
- Until I figure out how to launch this on a site it is not tbh gonna save it to a text file because I didn't think it fully thru wish I had doe
- git clone uh the link of this project and run it in your terminal type in uh python or py main.py yeee

### MAIN STEPS ON HOW TO CODE THIS ...... üñ•Ô∏è
- Get a PC (boomer joke yes I am old)
- Then Install pygame using pip install pygame AFTER YOU MAKE SURE PYTHON EXISTS otherwise it gonna be weird (wierd idk)
- start with creating a window then uh a icon and title and after that background or hero icon upto you 
- After that focus on animation or moving your hero icon left to right
- Then same for enemy now multiply them ( i did this last because it was annoying to handle bullets cuz I forgot I made then 16x16 px)
- After that Focus on bullet get one to work then go ham on it so each bullet be like each their own direction
- Last but not the least the GAME OVER SIGN
- I added music and song to it after I found this video which helped me with it (link *https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWpgLFMI7w*)
- Not the best explaination but tbh this video helped me alot wish I came across this sooner

*Have fun lads
Au Revoir!!!!* ‚úã
